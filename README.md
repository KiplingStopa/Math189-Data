This repository contains a homework project from my Math189 Data Analysis and Inference class at UCSD.
In this class I learned how to analyze large data sets using R software, and learned how to format reports on this data using RMarkdown.
For academic integrity reasons, I cannot share the homework file publicly on the internet, only our work and the answers we gave.
